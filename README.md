# PAndemic TRacking OnLine (PATROL)
An Android App which aims to protect users from pandemic by providing useful information. Users can view crowedness of a location through our real-time heatmap, search for history data of pandemic cases, self-report their symptoms, and checkout newest information from CDC Covid website.

# Project Introduction
This Android App was developed by a team of 6. I was responsible for the development of the History Data Visualization feature, which corresponds to 1/4 of the frontend development work (in Kotlin). Besides that, I contributed to 90% of the documentation work since the software was majorly based on my previous architectural design plan.
