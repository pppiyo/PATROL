# PATROL App Architectural Design Documentation
https://github.com/pppiyo/PATROL/blob/master/CSCI_578_Final_Project.pdf

# My Contribution
I led the software architecture design, implemented the History Data Visualization feature (25% of the frontend in Kotlin), and contributed 90% of the project documentation.

While we did not specify a team leader, I played a major part in tracking the project progress, initiating task assignment, and organizing team meetings.
