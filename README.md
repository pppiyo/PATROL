# PAndemic TRacking OnLine (PATROL)
An Android App designed to help users stay informed and safe during pandemics by providing real-time heatmaps, historical data on pandemic cases, self-reporting features, and CDC updates.

# Project Introduction & My Contribution
Developed by a team of 6, I led the overall software architecture design, implemented the History Data Visualization feature (25% of the frontend in Kotlin), and contributed 90% of the project documentation. 

While we did not specify a team leader, I played a major part in tracking the project progress, initiating task assignment, and organizing team meetings.
